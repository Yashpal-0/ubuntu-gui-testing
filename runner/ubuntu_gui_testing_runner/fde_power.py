"""Host-side power control for exactly one disposable TPM-FDE clone.

The Robot library runs inside Yarf, which does not install the libvirt Python
bindings, so this module drives libvirt through its documented ``virsh`` CLI.
Every lookup is pinned to the clone UUID the runner created, and the golden
source UUID is refused. The clone's libvirt definition must also expose the
vsock CID the case observes, so an echoed but foreign UUID cannot make a power
cut reach another domain. libvirt assigns the CID and the VNC port only while
the clone runs, so a restarted clone must come back on both before the case
talks to it again.
