...                 The runner signs a pre-OS driver with a 1024-bit RSA key,
...                 enrolls that certificate in the clone's db and dispatches
...                 the driver with Driver#### while the clone is stopped
...                 (fixture "prepare: preos-weak-sb"). Shim and grub keep
...                 their vendor signatures, so the firmware verifies the
...                 driver with the weak CA, and the driver's PCR4 measurement
...                 plus the added db entry (PCR7) make the TPM unseal fail,
...                 so the guest stops at snapd's recovery prompt and the
...                 suite setup unlocks it with the fixture's own key.
