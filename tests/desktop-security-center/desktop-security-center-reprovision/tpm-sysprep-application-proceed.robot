Documentation       Real SysPrep application then the proceed-only repair.
...                 The runner injects a signed pre-OS application into the
...                 clone's ESP and adds a SysPrep boot option while the clone
...                 is stopped (fixture "prepare: sysprep-app"). The changed
...                 PCR4 makes the TPM unseal fail, so the guest stops at
...                 snapd's recovery prompt and the suite setup unlocks it with
...                 the fixture's own key.
...
...                 secboot maps sys-prep-applications-present to no fixing
...                 action but does allow the check to proceed, so the product
...                 must offer the repair and complete it. snapd and polkit are
...                 the real ones; only the firmware state is mutated.
...
...                 The firmware dispatches the injected SysPrep#### option
...                 before the OS boot option, so the PCR4 load event exists for
...                 the check to report.
