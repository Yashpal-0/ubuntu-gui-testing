Documentation       Real pre-OS digest authorization then the proceed-only repair.
...                 The runner adds a SHA-256 digest entry to the clone's db and
...                 injects a pre-OS boot-service driver into the ESP with a
...                 Driver#### entry while the clone is stopped (fixture
...                 "prepare: preos-digest-sb"). The firmware dispatches that
...                 driver before the OS loader, so secboot sees a pre-OS
...                 component authenticated by an enrolled digest. The Canonical
...                 CA entries stay in db, so shim and grub are still verified
...                 by signature; the changed PCR4 and db (PCR7) make the TPM
...                 unseal fail, so the guest stops at snapd's recovery prompt
...                 and the suite setup unlocks it with the fixture's own key.

...                 must offer the repair and complete it. snapd and polkit
