Documentation       Host power cut during a real repair, then a clean retry.
...                 The clone starts at snapd's recovery prompt with a cleared
...                 TPM, so the installed Security Center offers a real
...                 reprovision. Once the user confirms, snapd's handler renames
...                 the old keyslots and adds the new recovery key before it
...                 seals the replacement TPM key. The host cuts power as soon
...                 as the handler's private stage signal changes, so the
...                 interrupted attempt has already replaced the keyslots but
...                 never sealed the new key.
...                 On the next boot snapd retries the interrupted task, finds
...                 the renamed keyslots without its in-memory repair context,
...                 restores the old keyslots, and fails the change with
...                 "missing reprovision context". The fixture's original
...                 recovery key must unlock the clone again, and the key the
...                 interrupted attempt had saved must unlock nothing. A second
...                 repair then has to complete and keep a working new key.
...                 Nothing here mocks snapd, polkit, or the TPM: the observer
...                 only reads the handler's private file and drives libvirt for
...                 the one disposable clone the runner created.
