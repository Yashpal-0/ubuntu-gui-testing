Documentation       Real TPM clear then full reprovisioning in one clone.
...                 The runner clears this clone's TPM state before it first
...                 boots (fixture "prepare: clear-tpm-state"), so the guest stops
...                 at snapd's recovery prompt before any SSH is possible and the
...                 suite setup unlocks it with the fixture's own key. The guest's
...                 own snapd detects the cleared endorsement hierarchy. The
...                 installed Security Center then repairs over the real
...                 /run/snapd.socket and the real polkit policy. Nothing in
...                 this case mocks snapd. The GUI runs as the desktop user;
...                 independent fixture and LUKS checks use a privileged helper.
...                 One case spans the whole flow because the runner selects
...                 exactly one case per disposable clone: a repair that is
...                 half executed in one clone and finished in another proves
...                 nothing.
